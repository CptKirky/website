<p>The progress presentation, which counts for 20% of the assessment, allows the group to present their progress and have a constructive discussion with their assessors.</p>

<p>The presentation itself should convey the following information to the assessors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>technical description of the project;</li>
  <li>current specification for product, as emerging from interaction with customer;</li>
  <li>details of progress to date;</li>
  <li>indication of prospects and plans for future work;</li>
  <li>description of the personnel and their roles in the management of the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a group wishes to present other material (such as to demonstrate prototype software on a laptop) they may do so, but it will not affect the marks received.</p>

<p>Groups should be aware that assessors viewing the presentation may not be familiar with the topic, and the overall &quot;plan&quot; for the project should be clear from the presentation.</p>

<p>By the end of the first week of Term 2 (at the latest) a feedback sheet on the progress presentation together with a final mark for this assessment stage of the project will be returned to each group via Tabula.</p>

<h2>Practical information</h2>

<p>The progress presentation will last (up to) 1 hour. Around 30 and 40 minutes should be spent presenting. The remaining time is for interaction and questions with the assessors (and customer/s, if present). Time will be allowed for setting up before the demonstration. The <strong>project moderator</strong> acts as chair for the presentation.</p>

<h2>Assessment Criteria</h2>

<p>The progress presentation allows us to monitor the project to ensure that the group is making suitable progress, and to offer you feedback which will help bring the project to a successful conclusion. The presentation should give an overview of the project, its motivation, its background, the design decisions made, and its current status. It is <em>not</em> intended to be a draft of part of the final presentation or the final report.</p>

<p>The following four criteria, which carry equal weight, will be used by the assessors in marking the progress presentation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical content 
    <ul>
      <li>Students well read and knowledgeable in the project's subject area.</li>
      <li>Good insight into the project's specific topic.</li>
      <li>Effective analysis of problems and issues given the customer requirements.</li>
      <li>Quality of design work.</li>
      <li>Appropriate choice of methods and tools.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Progress 
    <ul>
      <li>Progress consistent with the project specification.</li>
      <li>Initially unforeseen problems well detected and overcome.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Project Organisation and Management 
    <ul>
      <li>All necessary research, analysis, and design work on schedule.</li>
      <li>Team management.</li>
      <li>Communication with, and responsiveness to the customer.</li>
      <li>Work for next term well planned out.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Communication Skills 
    <ul>
      <li>Basic written language skills such as spelling and grammar.</li>
      <li>Effective composition in the context of a poster.</li>
      <li>Effective dialogue with the assessors.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>
