<p>
    The progress presentation, which counts for 20% of the assessment, allows the group to present their progress and have a constructive discussion with their assessors.
</p>

<p>
    The presentation itself should convey the following information to the assessors (this is not an exhaustive list and not all points are applicable to every project):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Effective communication of ideas</li>
    <li>Motivation</li>
    <li>Understanding of and grounding in relevant academic literature / related work</li>
    <li>Appropriate software design and development process, making use of modern and relevant technologies, libraries, tools, etc.</li>
    <li>Progress so far</li>
    <li>Plans to evaluate the work</li>
    <li>Project management processes</li>
    <li>Equal contribution of group members</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The format of the progress presentation is primarily intended to be in the form of a discussion between students and assessors that is guided by some slides. Other materials (such as prototype software etc.) that the group may wish to present are permissible.
</p>

<p>Groups should be aware that assessors viewing the presentation may not be familiar with the topic, and the overall &quot;plan&quot; for the project should be clear from the presentation.</p>

<p>By the end of the first week of Term 2 (at the latest) a feedback sheet on the progress presentation together with a final mark for this assessment stage of the project will be returned to each group via Tabula.</p>

<h2>Practical information</h2>

<p>The progress presentation will last (up to) 1 hour. Around 30 and 40 minutes should be spent presenting. The remaining time is for interaction and questions with the assessors (and customer/s, if present). The discussion with and questions from the assessors may take place at any point during the presentation, not necessarily the end. Time will be allowed for setting up before the demonstration. The <strong>project moderator</strong> acts as chair for the presentation.</p>

<h2>Assessment Criteria</h2>

<p>The progress presentation allows us to monitor the project to ensure that the group is making suitable progress, and to offer you feedback which will help bring the project to a successful conclusion. The presentation should give an overview of the project, its motivation, its background, the design decisions made, and its current status. It is <em>not</em> intended to be a draft of part of the final presentation or the final report.</p>

<p>The progress presentation will be awarded a mark out of 100 by each assessor (typically there are two assessors, but groups with multiple supervisors may have more) which are then reviewed by the moderator who decides on the final mark for the group. Assessors use the criteria listed at the top of this page in their assessment of the presentation. Each project is assessed on its own merits. As a guidance, </p>

<ul>
<li>A mark of 90 to 100 indicates that the work has been communicated clearly and carried out, with equal contributions from all members of the group, to a standard that is likely to lead to publication in a top conference/journal -or- is a highly polished and robust software engineering project of the highest perceivable quality that could realistically be distributed commercially at the end of the year.</li> 
<li>A mark of 80 to 89 indicates that the work has been communicated clearly and carried out, with equal contributions from all members of the group, to a standard that is likely to lead to publication in a conference/journal -or- is a highly polished and robust software engineering project of the highest perceivable quality that could realistically be distributed commercially at the end of the year with minor improvements.</li> 
<li>A mark of 70 to 79 indicates that the project narrowly misses the mark for publishable work, but does likely or will have some minor contributions -or- is a polished and relatively robust software engineering project that could be sold/distributed with sufficient polish at the end of the year.</li>
<li>A mark of 60 to 69 indicates a good project which meets all expectations for a fourth-year project, but is not exceptional in any way.</li>
<li>A mark of 50 to 59 indicates a project narrowly below expectations for a fourth-year group project.</li> 
<li>A mark of 40 to 49 indicates a project significantly below expectations for a fourth-year group project, but within acceptable scope for an MEng degree.</li> 
<li>A mark of 30 to 39 indicates a project that is currently on a trajectory unsuitable for an MEng degree, but that could be made suitable with minor changes.</li> 
<li>A mark of 20 to 29 indicates a project that is currently on a trajectory unsuitable for an MEng degree, but that could be made suitable with major changes.</li> 
<li>A mark of 0-10 indicates a project that is currently on a trajectory unsuitable for an MEng degree, but that could narrowly be made suitable with major changes.</li>
<li>A mark of 0 indicates no show, no work done, etc.</li>
</ul>
