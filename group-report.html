<p>The Group Report is jointly authored by the members of the group, is typically of length 30,000 words (excluding appendices), and counts for 60% of the assessment. Its purpose is to document the process of delivering the agreed software, from both a technical and a process management standpoint. The report should demonstrate that the group has applied their skills in the software development process, and also that they have worked together effectively as a team.</p>

<h2>Submission information</h2>

<p>Every member of the group should submit a PDF of the report to Tabula along with an archive of the project source code as well as any other extras such as data sets. </p>

<h2>Assessment Criteria</h2>

<p>The group report is the main mechanism we have for assessing your application of good practice, both technical and managerial, to the process of delivering your project.</p>

<p>The following eight criteria, which carry equal weight, will be used by the assessors in marking the report.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Specification 
    <ul>
      <li>Clear and complete problem definition.</li>
      <li>Clear, precise, achievable aims and intentions.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Design 
    <ul>
      <li>Appropriate use of a structured approach, or use of a formal or semi-formal methodology.</li>
