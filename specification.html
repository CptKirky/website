<p>The specification is not marked as a separate component, but is a <em>compulsory</em> milestone that must be passed for the project to continue. It should be a detailed document identifying the planned activities and schedule for the remainder of the project. The specification will be referred to when marks for the progress presentation are awarded.</p>

<h3>Technical specification</h3>

<p>The technical specification should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details that are as far as possible intelligible to the customer that provisionally specify the nature of the interfaces</li>
  <li>the range of functionalities to be expected of the final deliverable. </li>
  <li>It should contain some indication of the character of the work to be carried out, </li>
  <li>the estimated amount of work involved and </li>
  <li>the expected schedule.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Management</h3>

<p>The specification document should also set out the management and development strategies to be adopted in the project in a way that is intelligible to the authority to whom the software team is answerable (the &quot;line manager&quot;), giving a brief account supplemented by references where necessary to explain any special-purpose software or innovative practices or techniques that are to be used.</p>

<p>The management approach taken should be structured, and the development methodology to be employed must be included in the specification. The roles that the team members will play (if any) both in relation to interaction with customer and in the development process should also be indicated.</p>
