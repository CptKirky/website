<p>The final presentation, which counts for 10% of the assessment, allows the group to present their completed work to their assessors as well as to an audience, and allows members of the audience to question members of the group about their work. Depending on the type of project, the group will be expected to demonstrate their working software or present a poster of their research results.</p>

<h2>Practical information</h2>

<p>TBC.</p>

<p>Groups should indicate well in advance of the presentations what resources they require. For demos, lab machines will be available and you should ensure that your demo runs on them if you are planning to use them. Otherwise, you may bring your own laptop(s). For poster presentations, boards can be provided together with materials for affixing paper to them. Space will be available for one sheet of A0 paper. Material on the poster should be readable from a distance of approximately 1.5m. 
</p>

<p>For poster presentationsn, the Department will meet printing costs for the poster. Procedures may vary slightly each year. You should nominate a member of your group to be responsible for printing, and inform <strong>Maria Ferreiro Caamano (M.Ferreiro-Caamano@warwick.ac.uk)</strong> who you have chosen. Maria will arrrange with Warwick Print for the Department to be charged directly for the printing. The nominated person should then take your poster (and their student card/ID) to Warwick Print for printing. If you are going to email your poster to Warwick Print, please cc <strong>Maria</strong> (M.Ferreiro-Caamano@warwick.ac.uk) in the email so she can keep track of things. Warwick Print prefer you to prepare a PDF with an A4 printed preview of how it should look - you should talk to Warwick Print to confirm details for your specific poster and choice of preparation software. Warwick Print requests <strong>one week's notice</strong> to print your poster (it typically takes three days, but depends on workload). However, you should also allow additional contingency time for if there is a problem with printing.</p>

<h2>Assessment Criteria</h2>

<p>The presentation is aimed at evaluating how well the group can expose their work to an audience, and respond to questions from the assessors and other interested persons in a informal setting.</p>

<p>The following three criteria, which carry equal weight, will be used by the assessors in marking the final presentation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Presentation of the project to the audience
    <ul>
      <li>Clear exposition of the purpose of the project.</li>
      <li>Comprehensive coverage.</li>
      <li>Logical flow.</li>
      <li>Professionalism of delivery.</li>
      <li>Level of interest and evidence of innovation and creativity.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Discussion
    <ul>
      <li>Involvement - does each group member contribute to the discussion, does the group work cohesively together, and do the group members support each other?</li>
      <li>Professional approach - were questions adequately answered and do the group members argue their points logically, constructively, and in a structured manner?</li>
      <li>Forward thinking - is there evidence of thinking beyond the immediate boundaries of the project, for example in respect of future expansion or integration with other software?</li>
      <li>Critical engagement - does the group show awareness of the most significant issues, and of any complex and interesting questions relating to their project?</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Demonstration of software or research results
    <ul>
      <li>Appropriate demonstration of functionality or results.</li>
      <li>Completion (e.g. lack of errors or debugging interfaces).</li>
      <li>Polish (e.g. well designend user interfaces with documentation).</li>
      <li>Conceptual integrity and coherence of design as set out in the progress presentation.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>
