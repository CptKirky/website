<p>You must have chosen a project before the start of your final year, which means you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A group of 4-6 students,</li>
  <li>a name for the group,</li>
  <li>a supervisor,</li>
  <li>a project title,</li>
  <li>a customer</li>
</ul>

<p>The deadline by which you should have <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/material/cs407/group-membership/">registered a project</a> is the end of Year 3, so that your project is decided upon before the summer holidays when it becomes more difficult to get hold of members of staff to discuss supervision arrangements with. If you fail to meet this deadline, you should aim to find a group as soon as possible thereafter or risk being allocated to a group.</p>

<h2>Ideas for projects</h2>

<p>There are essentially two ways of finding a project. Either you select a project suggested by a member of staff (some colleagues maintain web pages with ideas on), or you can suggest a project yourself and approach staff to find a willing advisor who will be able to comment on how suitable of a proposal it is and help you flesh it out if necessary.</p>

<p>It can be a good idea to speak to your personal tutors before you begin your search, since they will be able to suggest which academics you might approach with expertise in the area of your interest, who might be suitable as a supervisor.</p>

<p>Once you have formed a group, you should <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/material/cs407/group-membership/">register it</a>. It can then be updated with your group name, project title, and supervisor as those details emerge.</p>

<h3>Some Tips</h3>

<p>Don't be shy! Academics <em>like</em> to talk to students about possible projects, and will welcome you consulting them.</p>

<p>Most staff are easier to communicate with via email, so make good use of it to both discuss projects and to arrange an appointment for you to visit. Many students are all too easily discouraged by knocking on an academic's door only to be greeted by their absence. So, avoid such demoralising situations by first trying to arrange an appointment via email.</p>

<h2>Resit and intercalating students</h2>

<p>Some students will not have been in residence at Warwick in the year preceding their final one, and may find difficulty contacting staff. For such students, email with staff is often sufficient, possibly supplemented with a visit to campus for face to face discussions. If you are in this category, and are finding a problem, you should contact the module organiser.</p>

<h2>Didn't find a group or a project?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the process for selecting a project should be completed by the end of the third year. If you are running late, please let the module organiser know in the first instance.</p>

<p>If you fail to find a group in time for the start of the third year, you will be allocated to one. You will then be expected to join with that group's choice of project.</p>

<p>If you fail to agree a project, a customer and a supervisor, you will be allocated a supervisor. You will then be expected to negotiate a project with that supervisor. This is not a situation you wish to be in, since we cannot guarantee you will be allocated a advisor whose interests match your own.</p>

<h2>Staff ideas for projects</h2>

<p>During Term 3 of year 3 all staff are asked to provide information on their areas of supervision and specific project proposals. The Staff Ideas page contains information on academics' project areas of interest and proposals. These pages will help you to discover projects which are ready to pick up and go, and also to become familiar with the research interests and skills of each academic. Check back regularly on these pages, as new project proposals often appear while others disappear as they are taken up.</p>
