<p>You must have chosen a project before the start of your final year, which means</p>

<ul>
  <li>title,</li>
  <li>abstract,</li>
  <li>customer, and</li>
  <li>advisor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The formal deadline is the end of Year 3, so that your project is decided upon before the summer holidays.</p>

<h2>Ideas for projects</h2>

<p>There are essentially two ways of finding the project. Either you can select a title suggested by a member of staff (and most colleagues maintain web pages with ideas on), or you can suggest a title yourself and approach staff to find a willing advisor.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to speak to your personal tutors before you begin your search, since they will be able to suggest which academics you might approach with expertise in the area of your interest, who might be suitable as a advisor.</p>

<p>Once you have found a title, a customer, an advisor, and agreed an abstract you must then fill in a project registration form, details of which will be supplied by the project organisers in Term 3.</p>

<h3>Some Tips</h3>

<p>Don't be shy! Academics <em>like</em> to talk to students about possible projects, and will welcome you consulting them.</p>

<p>Most staff are easier to communicate with via email, so make good use of it to both discuss projects and to arrange an appointment for you to visit. Many students are all too easily discouraged by knocking on an academic's door only to be greeted by their absence. So, avoid such demoralising situations by first trying to arrange an appointment via email.</p>

<h2>Resit and intercalating students</h2>

<p>Some students will not have been in residence at Warwick in the year preceding their final one, and may find difficulty contacting staff. For such students, email with staff is often sufficient, possibly supplemented with a visit to campus for face to face discussions. If you are in this category, and are finding a problem, you should contact the project organisers.</p>

<h2>Didn't find a group or a project?</h2>

<p>The process for select a project should be completed by the end of the third year. If you are running late, please let the module organiser know in the first place.</p>

<p>If you fail to find a group, you will be allocated to one. You will then be expected to join with that group's choice of project.</p>

<p>If you fail to agree a project, a customer and an advisor, you will be allocated a supervisor. You will then be expected to negotiate a project with that supervisor. This is not a situation you wish to be in, since we cannot guarantee you will be allocated a advisor whose interests match your own.</p>

<h2>Staff Ideas for Projects</h2>

<p>During Term 3 of year 3 all staff are asked to provide information on their areas of supervision and specific project proposals. The Staff Ideas page contains information on academics' project areas of interest and proposals. These pages will help you to discover projects which are ready to pick up and go, and also to become familiar with the research interests and skills of each academic. Check back regularly on these pages, as new project proposals often appear while others disappear as they are taken up.</p>
