<p>For CS407, you can use the <a href="https://waat.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/index.html">Warwick Assessment Automation Tool (WAAT)</a> to create a group, join an existing group, manage the group you are a member of, and complete other tasks that are part of the group registration process. This page provides documentation for these tasks.</p>

<h3>Creating a new group</h3>

<p> If you and several other students have decided to form a group, one of you can create the group on WAAT. The others will then be able to join that group. It does not matter which one of you creates the group as everyone will have the same permissions once joined. To get started, open the CS407 module on WAAT and click on the &quot;My group&quot; option in the menu on the left. You should see a screen telling you that you do not currently belong to a group: </p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-no-group.png"><img src="waat-no-group.png" border="0" /></a> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-create-group.png"><img src="waat-create-group.png" border="0" /></a> </div>

<p>Click on the &quot;Create a group&quot; button, read the confirmation dialog that pops up, and confirm that you would like to proceed. Afterwards, the new group will be created, you will join it, and you will be redirected to the group management view:</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-group-overview.png"><img src="waat-group-overview.png" border="0" /></a> </div>

<h3>Inviting others to join the group</h3>

<p>Once you have created a group, you can invite others to join it. You can find an invitation link at the bottom of the group management view:</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-group-invite-url.png"><img src="waat-group-invite-url.png" border="0" /></a> </div>

<p>Simply share this link with other students you want to invite to the group and they will be able to join it.</p>

<h3>Joining a group</h3>

<p>To join a group, you need the invitation link from an existing member of the group (see above). After following the link, you will see a page that asks you to confirm whether you wish to join the group:</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-join-group.png"><img src="waat-join-group.png" border="0" /></a> </div>

<p>Simply click on &quot;Join&quot; to join the group. The existing members of the group will receive My Warwick notifications to let them know that you have joined the group. You will then be redirected to the group management page.</p>

<h3>Changing the group name or project title</h3>

<p>To change the group name or project title, simply edit the fields at the top of the group management page and click &quot;Update&quot; to request an update:</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-group-info.png"><img src="waat-group-info.png" border="0" /></a> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-group-update-confirmation.png"><img src="waat-group-update-confirmation.png" border="0" /></a> </div>

<p>If you confirm the changes by clicking on the &quot;Update group details&quot; button, all other members of your group will receive My Warwick notifications informing them of your request to change the group details. Other members of the group will now be able to see your requested changes in the group management view:</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-group-change.png"><img src="waat-group-change.png" border="0" /></a> </div>

<p>All members of the group must accept the changes before they come into effect. If any member of the group rejects the changes, they will be discarded. Only one change request may be active at any given time - in other words, a decision needs to be reached before any further changes can be made.</p>

<h3>Registering a supervisor</h3>

<p>Once you have found a member of staff who has agreed to supervise your project (see <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/material/cs407/finding-a-project/">the guidance for finding a project</a> for advice on how to get there), they can be formally registered by clicking on the &quot;Register your supervisor&quot; button in the middle of the group management view. This will open a dialog screen which allows you to select the supervisor from the list of all available members of staff:</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-register-supervisor.png"><img src="waat-register-supervisor.png" border="0" /></a> </div>

<p>By clicking on &quot;Register&quot;, the selected member of staff will be notified and they can accept or reject the registration. This mechanism should not be used in place of first contacting potential supervisors via e.g. email to discuss the project ideas and get their approval first. Once a registration request has been sent, the supervisor will be shown as &quot;Pending&quot; until they approve the request:</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"> <a rel="lightbox" style="flex: 1; max-width: 400px;" href="waat-pending-supervisor.png"><img src="waat-pending-supervisor.png" border="0" /></a> </div>

<h3>Leaving a group</h3>

<p>Before group registrations are finalised, you have the option to leave your current group if you wish to join a different group. You can only do this if your group does not yet have a supervisor by clicking on the red button at the bottom of the group management page.  </p>
